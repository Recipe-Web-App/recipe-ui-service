## Common Questions

### Setup and Configuration

**Q: How do I get started?**
A: See the Quick Start section in [README.md](../README.md) and [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#quick-start-commands)

**Q: What environment variables are required?**
A: Check [`.env.example`](../.env.example) for all configuration options. You need to configure URLs for the 6
backend microservices.

**Q: How do I connect to backend services?**
A: Configure the service URLs in your `.env.local` file. See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#architecture-overview) for
the microservices architecture.

**Q: What Node.js version do I need?**
A: Node.js 20 or higher is required. See package.json for the exact version.

### Development

**Q: How do I run the development server?**
A: Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server with Turbopack.

**Q: How do I run tests?**
A: Run `npm test` for all tests, or see [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#testing-commands) for specific test commands.

**Q: What's the code structure?**
A: See Architecture Overview in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#architecture-overview) for the full project structure.

**Q: How do I add a new API integration?**
A: Follow the API Integration Pattern in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#api-integration-pattern) - create client, add
methods, create React hooks.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: Service fails to start?**

- Check logs: `npm run dev` output
- Verify Node.js version (`node --version`)
- Check dependencies are installed (`npm ci`)
- Review environment variables
- Check backend service connectivity

**Q: API calls are failing?**

- Verify backend services are running
- Check service URLs in `.env.local`
- Verify network connectivity
- Check browser console for errors
- Review CORS configuration

**Q: Tests are failing?**

- Run `npm ci` to ensure dependencies are fresh
- Check test output for specific errors
- Verify backend services are available for integration tests
- See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#testing) for testing guidelines

**Q: Build is failing?**

- Run `npm run type-check` to find TypeScript errors
- Run `npm run lint` to find linting issues
- Check for missing environment variables
- Review build output for specific errors

**Q: Performance issues?**

- Run `npm run analyze` to check bundle size
- Use `npm run perf:lighthouse` for performance audit
- Check for large dependencies
- See [Performance Issue Template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/performance_issue.yml)

### Components and Hooks

**Q: How do I create a new component?**
A: Follow existing patterns in `src/components/`. See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#when-creating-components) for guidelines.

**Q: How do I integrate with a backend service?**
A: Create API client in `src/lib/api/[service]/`, add types in `src/types/[service]/`, create hooks in `src/hooks/[service]/`.

**Q: How do I manage state?**
A: Use TanStack Query for server state, Zustand for client state. See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#state-management).
