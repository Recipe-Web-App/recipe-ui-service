## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# With coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Integration tests for API integration and user workflows
- E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Aim for 85%+ code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Test Guidelines

- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock API calls appropriately
- Include accessibility testing
- Clean up resources in test teardown

## Code Style

### Code Quality Commands

```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Run all checks
npm run quality
```

### Style Guidelines

- Follow TypeScript and React best practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Document complex logic
- Use proper TypeScript types (avoid `any`)
- Follow existing code patterns
