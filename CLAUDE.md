This document provides comprehensive guidance for using Claude Code with this Recipe UI Service project,
optimizing your AI-assisted development workflow.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Setting Up Claude Code for This Project

1. **Project Recognition**: Claude Code automatically recognizes this as a Next.js project with enterprise-grade tooling
2. **Context Loading**: Key project files are automatically indexed for better assistance
3. **Tool Integration**: All project scripts and tools are available for Claude Code operations

### Key Project Commands for Claude Code

```bash
# Development workflow
npm run dev                    # Start development server
npm run build                 # Production build
npm run test                  # Run all tests
npm run lint                  # Code quality checks

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Claude Code Workflows

### 1. **Development Workflow Integration**

#### Starting a New Feature

```bash
# Claude Code can help you:
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
npm run dev                   # Start development server
npm run test:watch           # Start test watcher
```

**Claude Code Tips:**

- Mention the feature you're building for context-aware suggestions
- Ask Claude to generate component boilerplate following project patterns
- Request test cases that match the project's testing strategy

#### Code Quality Assurance

```bash
# Run these before committing (Claude Code can run these for you):
npm run lint                 # ESLint with 60+ rules
npm run type-check          # TypeScript validation
npm run test                # Unit and integration tests
npm run format              # Prettier formatting
```

### 2. **AI-Assisted Code Generation**

#### Component Creation

When asking Claude Code to create components, mention:

- **Project structure**: "Create a component following the src/components structure"
- **Styling approach**: "Use TailwindCSS with our design system"
- **Testing requirements**: "Include unit tests with React Testing Library"
- **TypeScript**: "Use strict TypeScript with proper interfaces"

**Example Request:**

```text
Create a RecipeCard component in src/components/ui/ that displays recipe
information, uses TailwindCSS styling, includes proper TypeScript interfaces,
and follows our project's component patterns. Also create unit tests.
```

#### API Integration

For API-related code:

- Reference `src/lib/api/client.ts` for HTTP client patterns
- Use TanStack Query patterns from `src/hooks/use-recipes.ts`
- Follow error handling patterns established in the project

**Example Request:**

```text
Create a new API hook for user management that follows the TanStack Query
patterns in src/hooks/use-recipes.ts, uses our API client from
src/lib/api/client.ts, and includes proper error handling.
```

### 3. **Testing Integration**

#### Test Generation

Claude Code can generate tests following project patterns:

```bash
# Test types available:
npm run test:unit            # Unit tests
npm run test:integration     # Integration tests
npm run test:e2e            # End-to-end tests
npm run test:coverage       # Coverage reports
```

**Testing Request Examples:**

```text
Generate unit tests for the RecipeCard component using React Testing Library,
following the patterns in tests/unit/components/. Include accessibility
testing and user interaction scenarios.

Create integration tests for the recipe creation workflow following the
frontend integration test patterns in tests/integration/frontend/.
```

### 4. **Performance Optimization**

#### Performance Analysis

Claude Code can help analyze and optimize performance:

```bash
# Performance commands Claude Code can run:
npm run analyze             # Bundle analysis
npm run size-limit         # Bundle size validation
npm run perf:vitals        # Core Web Vitals testing
npm run perf:lighthouse    # Lighthouse audits
```

**Performance Request Example:**

```text
Analyze the current bundle size using npm run analyze and suggest
optimizations for the largest chunks. Focus on code splitting and
tree shaking opportunities.
```

# Pre-commit simulation:
npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run test
```

## üìù Best Practices for Claude Code Interaction

### 1. **Context Sharing**

**Provide Clear Context:**

```text
I'm working on the Recipe UI Service project. I need to add user authentication
to the existing Zustand store in src/stores/auth-store.ts. The project uses
TanStack Query for API calls and follows strict TypeScript patterns.
```

**Reference Project Files:**

```text
Looking at src/lib/api/client.ts, help me add error retry logic that follows
the same patterns used for the recipes API in src/lib/api/recipes.ts.
```

### 2. **Code Generation Requests**

**Specific Structure Requests:**

```text
Create a new page component in src/app/profile/ that follows Next.js 15 App
Router patterns, uses server components where appropriate, and integrates
with our existing auth store.
```

**Testing Requests:**

```text
Generate comprehensive tests for the authentication flow that cover both
happy path and error scenarios, following the testing patterns in
tests/integration/frontend/workflows/.
```

### 3. **Problem Solving**

**Debug Assistance:**

```text
I'm getting a TypeScript error in src/components/forms/RecipeForm.tsx.
The error is about type inference for form validation. Can you help
debug this while maintaining compatibility with our ESLint rules?
```

**Performance Issues:**

```text
The app is loading slowly. Can you analyze the components in src/components/
and suggest React.memo or useMemo optimizations that follow our performance
guidelines?
```

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Claude doesn't understand project structure"

**Solution:**

```text
Explicitly reference key files and explain the project structure:
"This Next.js 15 project uses App Router (src/app/), components in src/components/,
and API integration via src/lib/api/. We use Zustand for state management
and TanStack Query for server state."
```

### Issue: "Generated code doesn't match project patterns"

**Solution:**

```text
Reference existing code patterns:
"Generate this following the same patterns used in src/components/ui/Button.tsx
and the testing approach from tests/unit/components/Button.test.tsx"
```

### Issue: "TypeScript errors in generated code"

**Solution:**

```text
Specify TypeScript requirements upfront:
"Use strict TypeScript with proper interfaces defined in src/types/,
following the patterns in src/types/index.ts"
```
