### Auto-Merge Strategy

#### Patch Updates

- **Action**: Auto-approve and auto-merge
- **Rationale**: Patch updates are backward-compatible bug fixes

#### Minor Updates (Indirect Dependencies)

- **Action**: Auto-approve and auto-merge
- **Rationale**: Indirect dependencies with minor version bumps are low-risk
- **Safety**: All CI checks must pass

#### Minor Updates (Direct Dependencies)

- **Action**: Auto-approve only (manual merge required)
- **Rationale**: Direct dependencies need review for API changes
- **Safety**: Allows time for testing

#### Major Updates

- **Action**: Comment only (full manual review required)
- **Comment**: Warns that major version update requires manual review

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Repository Setup

Ensure the following secrets are configured in your repository:

```yaml
Required Secrets:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: GitHub personal access token
  RELEASE_TOKEN: Token with release permissions
  SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: Slack notification webhook
  CODECOV_TOKEN: Code coverage reporting
  LIGHTHOUSE_CI_TOKEN: Lighthouse CI integration

Optional Secrets:
  SNYK_TOKEN: Snyk security scanning
  SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN: Semgrep security analysis
  DOCKER_SCOUT_TOKEN: Docker security scanning
  STAGING_KUBECONFIG: Staging Kubernetes config
  PRODUCTION_KUBECONFIG: Production Kubernetes config
```

### 2. Branch Protection

Configure branch protection rules for `main`:

```yaml
Required:
  - Require status checks to pass
  - Require branches to be up to date
  - Require review from code owners
  - Dismiss stale reviews
  - Require signed commits

Status Checks:
  - ci/github-actions-ci
  - security/github-actions-security
  - test-suite/advanced-testing
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Set up GitHub environments:

```yaml
Environments:
  - staging (auto-deploy)
  - production-approval (manual approval)
  - production (protected)
```

### 4. Dependabot Setup

Dependabot is enabled via the `.github/dependabot.yml` configuration file.

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### Workflow Monitoring

Track workflow performance and success rates:

- **Success Rate**: Target >95% for all workflows
- **Duration Monitoring**: Alert on significant increases
- **Failure Analysis**: Root cause analysis for failures
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor runner usage and costs

### Performance Baselines

Maintain performance baselines and alert on regressions:

- **Core Web Vitals**: Monthly baseline updates
- **Bundle Size**: Progressive size limit adjustments
- **Test Duration**: Optimize for faster feedback
- **Deployment Time**: Target <20 minutes for full deployment

### Security Monitoring

Continuous security posture monitoring:

- **Vulnerability Trends**: Track vulnerability introduction/resolution
- **Dependency Health**: Monitor dependency age and security
- **Secret Detection**: Prevent credential leakage
- **Compliance Drift**: Maintain security compliance standards

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. CI Pipeline Failures

```bash
# Check logs in GitHub Actions
# Common causes:
- Test failures
- Linting errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- Build issues
```

#### 2. Deployment Issues

```bash
# Kubernetes deployment problems:
kubectl get pods -n staging
kubectl logs -f deployment/recipe-ui-service -n staging

# Health check failures:
curl -f https://staging.recipe-app.example.com/api/health
```

#### 3. Performance Regressions

```bash
# Bundle size analysis:
npm run analyze

# Performance profiling:
npm run perf:vitals
npm run perf:lighthouse
```

#### 4. Security Scan Failures

```bash
# Local security scanning:
npm audit --audit-level=high
npx secretlint "**/*"
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for workflows by setting repository variable:

```yaml
ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Commit Messages

Use conventional commits for automatic release management:

```bash
feat: add user authentication system
fix: resolve memory leak in data processing
feat!: change API response format (breaking change)
docs: update deployment documentation
test: add integration tests for payment flow
```

### 2. Pull Request Guidelines

- **Small, focused changes**: Easier to review and test
- **Descriptive titles**: Clear description of changes
- **Test coverage**: Ensure adequate test coverage
- **Documentation**: Update docs for user-facing changes
- **Performance impact**: Consider bundle size and performance

### 3. Security Guidelines

- **No secrets in code**: Use environment variables and secrets management
- **Regular updates**: Keep dependencies updated
- **Least privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Audit trail**: Maintain comprehensive logs

### 4. Performance Guidelines

- **Bundle size awareness**: Monitor and optimize bundle size
- **Code splitting**: Implement proper code splitting
- **Image optimization**: Optimize images and assets
- **Caching strategy**: Implement effective caching
