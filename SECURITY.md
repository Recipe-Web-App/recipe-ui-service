# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Security Overview

The Recipe UI Service follows security-first development practices with multiple layers of protection:

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Critical Security Issues

**⚠️ For critical security vulnerabilities, do NOT create a public issue.**

Instead, please follow our responsible disclosure process:

1. **Email**: Send details to [jsamuelsen11@gmail.com](mailto:jsamuelsen11@gmail.com)
2. **Subject**: Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
3. **Response**: We will respond within 24 hours
4. **Disclosure**: Please allow us time to fix the issue before public disclosure

### Non-Critical Security Issues

For low-risk security improvements or general security discussions, you may:

- Use our [Security Issue Template](https://github.com/jsamuelsen/recipe-web-app/issues/new?template=security_issue.yml)
- Discuss in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/jsamuelsen/recipe-web-app/discussions)

## 🔒 Security Measures

### Code Security

- **ESLint Security Plugin**: 8+ security-focused rules
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Type safety and null checking
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Secret Detection**: Multi-layer secret scanning

### Container Security

- **Non-root User**: Containers run as user `1001:1001`
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Immutable container runtime
- **Security Context**: No new privileges, dropped capabilities
- **Distroless Base**: Minimal attack surface

### Network Security

- **Content Security Policy**: XSS and injection protection
- **Security Headers**: HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- **Input Validation**: Sanitized user inputs
- **Authentication**: Secure token management

### Infrastructure Security

- **Secrets Management**: Encrypted secrets in CI/CD
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolated environments
- **Monitoring**: Security event logging

## 🔍 Security Testing

### Automated Security Scans

- **SAST (Static)**: Code analysis for vulnerabilities
- **SCA (Dependencies)**: Third-party package scanning
- **Container Scanning**: Image vulnerability assessment
- **Secret Scanning**: Leaked credentials detection

### Security Test Coverage

- **Input Validation**: XSS, SQL injection prevention
- **Authentication**: Token handling and session management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access controls
- **Data Protection**: Encryption and data handling

## 📋 Security Checklist
